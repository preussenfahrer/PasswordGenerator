# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Functionality
This is a basic JavaScript application that will set a secure password for those who choose to ues it.
Users are promted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. A series of alerts prompts the user
to select the length of their password (screenshot 1), then the user is offered the choice of whether or 
not they want to use uppercase (screenshot 2), lowercase (screenshot 3), special characters (screenshot 4), and numbers (screenshot 5).
Based on the selection and the user preferences, the generator will display the secure password in a text box (screenshot 6). The end
result of the application is that the user receives a randomized and secure password, each time that the choose to ues the application.
